# Encoding

The .ccb files are encoded using hexadecimal notation. Therefore, if you want to manually edit one, it is highly recommended that you use a hexeditor.

This is because if you try to edit a .ccb file, it tries to translate the bytes inside the file to an ASCII representation, whilst we are interested in the numeric representation of the bytes.
